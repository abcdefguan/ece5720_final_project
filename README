Compile with: make

Usage:

Sequential Algorithms:
./prim n e
./kruskal n e
./boruvka n e
./boruvka2 n e

Parallel Algorithms:
./filter_kruskal n e p
./parallel_boruvka n e p

Where:
n = number of nodes in graph (randomly generated)
e = number of edges in graph
p = number of threads used (for parallel algorithms)

Boruvka is a version of Boruvka's algorithm that does explicit graph merging
Boruvka2 is a version of Boruvka's algorithm that merges the graph implicitly. It's about 2-3x faster than Boruvka.
